## Text Adventure Game - Battle Simulator

This is a text-based adventure game featuring a battle simulation between players and various monsters. The player controls a character who levels up, gains experience points, and increases their stats as they defeat enemies. The goal of the game is to survive multiple battles against randomly chosen monsters.

### How to Play

1. Run the `game.py` file using Python 3.x.
2. Follow the prompts provided by the game to control your character and engage in battles.
3. Use the number keys (1 or 2) to choose actions during combat encounters.
4. Defeat monsters to earn experience points and increase your character's level, which improves their maximum hitpoints and attack power.
5. Be careful not to die in battle, as doing so will end the game prematurely.
6. Enjoy the thrill of adventuring and fighting monsters in this text-based RPG!

### Game Mechanics

#### Combat System

When encountering a monster, you must decide whether to attack or flee. Choose option 1 to attack the monster and deal damage based on your character's attack power. If successful, the monster's health decreases, and you receive experience points upon victory. However, if the monster survives your attack, it retaliates with a counterattack.

Choose option 2 to attempt to flee from the battle. There's a 60% chance of successfully escaping, allowing you to avoid taking damage. If you fail to flee, the monster attacks you, potentially causing significant harm.

#### Experience Points & Leveling Up

As you defeat monsters, you earn experience points (EXP). Reaching certain thresholds of EXP triggers a level-up event, increasing your character's maximum hitpoints (HP) by 50%, attack power by 25%, and awarding a congratulatory message.

#### Enemies

Three types of monsters exist in the game: Slimes, Zombies, and Skeletons. Each monster has different base attributes such as health, attack power, and experience point rewards upon defeat. These values may vary due to randomization during combat encounters.
